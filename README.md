# Financial Loan Risk Analysis

# Business Problem-
Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults. The objective of this project is to analyze historical loan data to identify key factors that influence loan approval decisions and default risk, enabling better risk assessment and data-driven decision-making.

# Dataset Description-
The dataset contains 45,000+ loan records, including:
1. Customer demographic details
2. Loan amount and interest rate
3. Credit-related attributes
4. Loan status (approved / defaulted)
5. The data required cleaning and preprocessing before analysis

# Tools & Technologies Used-
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy) - Used For EDA and Feature Engineering Purpose
2. Power BI - Data Visualization Purspose

# Steps Performed-
1. Performed data understanding and quality checks
2. Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records
3. Cleaned and preprocessed data using Python
4. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Univariate analysis
6. Bivariate analysis
7. Multivariate analysis
8. Used SQL queries for aggregation and data extraction
9. Identified key risk-related KPIs
10. Created visualizations and insights for loan risk patterns

# Key Insights-
1. Customers with higher loan amounts and lower income showed increased default risk
2. Certain loan categories and grades had significantly higher rejection rates
3. Interest rate and loan amount strongly influenced default probability
4. Loan approval trends varied noticeably across customer segments

# Dashboard / Visual Output-
1. Power BI dashboards were created to visualize:
2. Loan approval vs rejection trends
3. Default risk distribution
4. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
(Dashboard screenshots added in the repository)

# Business Recommendations-
1. Introduce stricter credit checks for high loan amounts
2.  Offer lower interest rates to low-risk customers
3. Monitor self-employed applicants more closely
   
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can help financial institutions reduce loan risk, improve approval decisions, and identify high-risk customer profiles using data-driven insights.
